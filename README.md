# **Bank Tech Test Version**


A practice tech test to create a bank app where a user can deposit money, withdraw money and view their statement. I will be completing this test in Ruby using Rspec as a testing framework and Rubocop as a linter. It will need to be run in a REPL such as IRB in order to use the application.

## **User Stories:**

The following user stories are derived from the specification of the project.

```
As a user,
So that I can store money,
I would like to be able to deposit money.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can spend my money,
I would like to be able to withdraw my money.
```
```
As a user,
So that I can keep track of my money,
I would like to be able to see an account statement.
