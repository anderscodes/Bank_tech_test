# **Bank Tech Test Version **


A practice tech test to create a bank app where a user can deposit money, withdraw money and view their statement. I will be completing this test in Ruby using Rspec as a testing framework and Rubocop as a linter. It will need to be run in a REPL such as IRB in order to use the application.
